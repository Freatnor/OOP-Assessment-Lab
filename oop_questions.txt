1. Describe the difference between a Class and an Object.
    A class is the piece of code that includes definitions and is responsible for any static values/functionality. It includes
     any declarations of subclassing/interfacing, etc. The object is a specific instance of the class as a distinct group of
     internal variables but has the structure and functionality defined in the class.


2. What keyword do you use to turn a normal Class into a Subclass? (choose one)
  a. implements
  b. extends  X
  c. uses
  d. sub


3. Describe the difference between public and private?
    public allows anything outside of the scope to see it, private only things within the scope it is defined.


4. Can a subclass access a private method of its parent class? (choose one)
  a. Yes
  b. No  X


5. Define the term constructor.
    it's a special method for each class that instantiates the class as an object in memory with it's own set of variables and such.


6. Can you access a static method of a class without making an instance of it? (choose one)
  a. Yes X
  b. No


7. Describe the purpose of overriding a method.
    overloading allows the developer to have a subclass have the same method signature as any super class but different
    implementation. This can be useful when a class/object wants to have the same method, like "toString()", output something different from the parent
